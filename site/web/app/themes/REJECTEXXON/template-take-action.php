					<h3>There are three critical reasons why Senators must Reject Rex, and Exxon:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Rex Tillerson is a personal friend and business partner of Russiaâ€™s autocratic ruler Vladimir Putin (the man who just hacked our Presidential election).</li>
						<li>Rex is a climate denier.  Under his leadership, Exxon has funded climate denial, and attacked activists, scientists, and elected leaders who are trying to discover the truth of what Exxon knew about climate, and when they knew it.</li>
						<li>We cannot let US foreign policy be dominated by oil interests. America has fought far too many Oil Wars already. No more blood for oil.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Sincerely,<br>
					[Your Name]<br>
					[Your Contact Information]</p>
